# Hydropower cascade structure

The hydropower cascade structure is a structure of Swiss hydropower plants and their hydrologic interrelations.

## History

The cascade structure has been initially developed for Swissmod, a Swiss electricity market model developed and maintained by University of Basel's FoNEW chair (Hannes Weigt, Jonas Savelsberg, Ingmar Schlecht). Parts of it are based on prior work by Markus Balmer, who used to work on hydropower at ETH Zurich's CEPE chair.
